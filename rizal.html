Springing of revolutions in Europe and the rise of liberalism. Back then there were a no such thing as nationalism. They identify themselves using their ethnicity or their monarchs. Imagine Philippine identity is gone and we identify ourselves such as Tagalog, Bisaya or Ilocano. Spain was affected from that event though not immediately as other countries. But it strengthened the liberals and reforms were taking place. One of the reforms were exposure of Philippines to European ideas.</td>
