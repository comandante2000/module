    <h1>Self - Evaluation:</h1>
    <h2>1.How to form an alternate polarity in the field coils?</h2>
    <h3>-	By connecting the interpoles.</h3>
    <h2>2.How the current flows in a long shunt cumulative </h2>
    <h3>-	a long shunt motor is connected in parallel with the series amalgamation of both series field coil and the armature.</h3>
    <h2>3.Defined as one in which the shunt field is connected across the line so that the series and the shunt fields have opposite polarity in the same pole.
        -	
        </h2>
    <h3>-	a two-pole shunt motor which is reversed by interchanging the armature leads.</h3>
    <h2>4.When the shunt field of a compound motor is connected to the armature terminals instead of across the line.</h2>
    <h3>-	The interpoles</h3>
    <h2>5.How to reverse the direction of rotation of the DC series motor</h2>
    <h3>-	By changing the direction of current flow through the armature or through the field.</h3>
    <h2>6.What are the uncommon procedures in rewinding between AC motor and Armature winding?</h2>
    <h3>-	Perform in sequence and Taking Data</h3>
    <h2>7.Before an armature is wound. To prevent the wires from touching the iron core and causing grounds. What must it be?</h2>
    <h3>-	Must be insulated</h3>
    <h2>8.Describe the simplex lap winding.</h2>
    <h3>-	The terminating end of one coil is joined to the commutator segment and the starting end of the next coil is placed under the same pole.</h3>
    <h2>9.If the smaller number is used, the motor will run in one direction; and if the larger number is used, the armature will rotate in the opposite direction.</h2>
    <h3>-	Retrogressive and Progressive windings</h3>
    <h2>10.Give the three groups of wave windings.</h2>
    <h3>-	Simplex wave winding, duplex wave winding and triplex wave winding.
        -	
        </h3>
        <h1>POST TEST</h1>
        <h2>1.The rotating part of a DC Motor that consists of laminated core with slots in which coils of wire are placed.</h2>
    <h3>-	The armature</h3>
    <h2>2.Another purpose that the two endplates, fastened to the frame with bolts, bear the weight of the armature. </h2>
    <h3>-	and keep it equidistant from the pole pieces. </h3>
    <h2>3Two types of bearings that contains the endplates in which shaft of the armature revolves.
        -	
        </h2>
    <h3>-	sleeve bearings or ball bearings</h3>
    <h2>4.Explain how DC motor works.</h2>
    <h3>-	A DC Motor is a machine which, when supplied with electric current, can be used for such mechanical work as driving pumps, running machine tools, and so on. DC Motors are also widely used in applications that require control of speed.</h3>
    <h2>5.DC Motor contains of field composed of many turns of fine wire.</h2>
    <h3>-	Shunt motor</h3>
    <h2>6.Describe the connection of DC Series motor.</h2>
    <h3>-	Contains field coils composed of few turns of heavy wire connected in series with the armature.</h3>
    <h2>7.This motor has a high starting torque and a variable speed characteristic.</h2>
    <h3>-	Series motor</h3>
    <h2>8.Describe the connection of a Compound DC Motor</h2>
    <h3>-	In this type of motor, each field coil is a combination of the series and shunt fields and is made in two sections


    </h3>
    <h2>9.Series field coils are wound with comparatively few turns of heavy wire whose diameter depends on the polarity of the main poles and the direction of rotation of the motor.</h2>
    
    <h2>10.What is the purpose Interpole Field?</h2>
    <h3>-	The field generated by the interpoles produces the same effect as the compensating winding. 	
        </h3>
