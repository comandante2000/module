    <h3>1. The motor starter has two circuits the power circuit and the control circuit.</h3>
    <h3>2. The power circuit runs from the line to the motor </h3>
    <h3>3. The power (main) contacts carry the motor current </h3>
    <h3>4. Three phase motors are reversed by interchanging any two of the three power leads to the motor. Full-voltage reversing (FVR) starters have two contactors (un forward and run-reverse).</h3>
    <h3>5. Full Voltage starters, also referred to as across-the-line starters or direct-on line (DOL) starters, are full-voltage non-reversing (FVNR) and connect the motor to a power line. </h3>
  <h3>6.Low Voltage Protection which prevents automatic restarting of equipment after a power failure, is usually not possible with a manual starter. This means, if the power fails, the power contacts remain closed (toggle or button in ON position). </h3>
    <h3>7. The Reversing Starter or Full Voltage reversing any two leads to the motor. This is accomplished with two contactors and reverses a motor by one overload relay. </h3>
<h3>8.Contactor control the electric current to the motor. Their function is to repeatedly establish and interrupt an electrical power circuit </h3>
<h3>9. A Starter is a device that controls the use of electrical power to equipment usually a motor. As the name implies, starters "start" motors. They can also stop hem, reverse them, and protect them. Starters are made from two building blocks,</h3>
<h3>10 Across the line or Full voltage non-reversing is the most commonly used general purpose starter. This starter connects the incoming power directly to the motor 
</h3>
<h3>11-14. Give some application of Full-voltage magnetic Reversing Starter. Conveyors, hoist, machine tools and elevators.</h3>
<h3>15. Full-voltage magnetic Reversing Starter are using two sets of main auxiliary contacts? </h3>
