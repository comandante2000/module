<ol>
<li>What is full-voltage magnetic, starter? And explain the important of full-voltage magnetic starter.</li>
</ol>
<p>- They facilitate the starting and stopping of the motor. The starters are rated by power (horsepower, kilowatt) and current (amperes). They provide the necessary overload protection for the motor.</p>
<ol start="2">

<p>- A push button switch controls an action in a machine or other type of process. They are common features within the home and workplace, and are also referred to as pushbutton switches or push switches</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the function of overload relay in Full- Voltage Startter?</li>
</ol>
<p>- Overload relays&nbsp;protect the motor, motor branch circuit, and motor branch circuit components from excessive heat from the overload condition. Overload relays are part of the motor starter (assembly of contactor plus overload relay). They protect the motor by monitoring the current flowing in the circuit.</p>
