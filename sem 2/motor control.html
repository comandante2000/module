    <h2>1 Explain what is function of Full-voltage Starter? </h2>
    <h3>- Full-voltage starters, also referred to as across-the-line starters or direct-on-line (DOL) starters, are full-voltage non-reversing (FVNR) and connect the motor to a power line</h3>
    <h2>2. Motor starter has two circuits, what are the two circuits and their function? </h2>
    <h3>- The motor starter has two circuits: the power circuit and the control circuit. The power circuit runs from the line to the motor. Electricity passes through the contacts of a starter, the overload relay and out to the motor. The power (main) contacts carry the motor current.</h3>
    <h2>3. How many sets of magnetic contactors are used for Full-voltage Reversing Starter and explain.</h2>
    <h3>- The contacts are classified as power contact, auxiliary contact, and contact spring. There are two types of power contact; stationary contact and movable contact. The material used for the contacts has stable arc resistance and high welding resistance.</h3>
